    title: Startup Initialization Sequence Test
    description: |
      Verify that the system executes the complete initialization sequence within 5 seconds
      and transitions from OFF to INITIALIZING to READY states in the correct order.

    title: Service Availability Verification Test
    description: |
      Test that the system correctly verifies service availability during startup. Verify that
      the system enters degraded/SAFE_MODE when a critical service fails to initialize.

    title: Startup Progress Indication Test
    description: |
      Verify that visual feedback (progress indicator or splash screen) is displayed during
      startup and remains visible until the system reaches READY state.

    title: Graceful Shutdown Sequence Test
    description: |
      Verify that the system executes a graceful shutdown sequence, terminating all services
      in the correct order and completing within 3 seconds. Verify state transition from
      READY to SHUTTING_DOWN to OFF.

    title: Data Persistence on Shutdown Test
    description: |
      Verify that all critical user data (settings, session state, media playback position)
      is persisted to non-volatile storage during shutdown and can be restored on next startup.
      Test data integrity even when shutdown is interrupted.

    title: State Transition Atomicity Test
    description: |
      Verify that state transitions are atomic and the system rejects new commands during
      critical transitions (INITIALIZING, SHUTTING_DOWN).

    title: Error Recovery During Startup Test
    description: |
      Test that the system attempts automatic recovery up to 3 times when encountering errors
      during startup. Verify that the system enters SAFE_MODE after failed recovery attempts
      and logs errors appropriately.
